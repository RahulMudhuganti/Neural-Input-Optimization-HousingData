# Neural Input Optimization (NIO) – Housing Price Planning

This project demonstrates Neural Input Optimization (NIO), where a neural network is trained on housing data, frozen, and then used to optimize input variables via backpropagation to achieve a desired target output.

## Dataset
California Housing Dataset (U.S. Census-based)

## Key Steps
- Trained a regression neural network (PyTorch)
- Froze model weights
- Optimized input variables via gradient descent
- Applied realistic constraints to inputs
- Visualized convergence and results

## Results
The NIO process successfully finds interpretable housing characteristics that achieve a target house value.

## Technologies
PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
